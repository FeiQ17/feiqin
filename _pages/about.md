I am Fei Qin, and I obtained my Ph. D. in Agricultural Economics from the [Department of Agricultural Economics](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/agecon/) at Purdue University. Before coming to Purdue, I earned my Master in Labor Economics from Shaanxi Normal University and my Bachelor's degree in Finance from Xi'an Jiaotong University. During my Master's program, I received the scholarship from China Scholarship Council, which allowed me to study in University of California, Berkeley as a short-term visiting student from November 2016 to May 2017. 

My primary research interests lie in the intersection of agricultural/food economics, industrial organizations, and development economics. Under this broad scope, I am particularly interested in two areas: 1) organizations (e.g., manufacturers and retailers) in the food sector and their strategic actions, especially the non-price strategies (e.g., product assortment), and 2) the impacts of policies/regulations/local shocks on the firmâ€™s competing strategies. The countries I have been focused on are the United States and China. I have particularly solid experience in policy evaluation and analyzing large datasets such as the retailer and household scanner data.

Starting in August 2023, I will be joining the Morrison School of Agribusiness at Arizona State University as a postdoctoral researcher.

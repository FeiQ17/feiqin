I am Fei Qin, a Ph. D. candidate from the [Department of Agricultural Economics](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/agecon/) at Purdue University. Before came to Purdue, I earned my Master in Labor Economics from Shaanxi Normal University and my Bachelor in Finance from Xi'an Jiaotong University. During my master, I received the scholarship from China Scholarship Council, which allowed me to study in University of California, Berkeley as a short-term visiting student from November 2016 to May 2017. 

My primary research interests lie in agricultural economics, industrial organizations, agricultural marketing, and development economics. Under this broad scope, I am particularly interested in two areas: 1) organizations in the food sector and their competitive strategies. The countries I have been focused on are the United States and China. I have particularly solid experience in policy evaluation and analyzing large datasets like the retailer and consumer scanner data.

At Purdue, I have gained valuable experience by serving as a teaching assistant and as a guest lecturer, and by involving in a student mentor-mentee program. My main teaching interests are agricultural and food economics, with a special focus on agricultural markets and industrial organization. These topics may also appeal individuals from a variety of fields, such as food science. Given my research background in food market in the U.S. and China, I am confident that I can competently teach courses related to agricultural supply chain, food demand, and agricultural marketing. I also look forward to teaching a wider range of topics, including policy evaluation and applied microeconomics.

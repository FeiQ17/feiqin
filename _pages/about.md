My name is Fei Qin, and I am currently working as a postdoctoral research assistant at the [Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability](https://ag.purdue.edu/cfdas/) (CFDAS) in the [Department of Agricultural Economics at Purdue University](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/agecon/), under the guidance of [Dr. Joseph Balagtas](https://ag.purdue.edu/directory/balagtas). I obtained my Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics from the Department of Agricultural Economics at Purdue University in 2023. I visited the University of California, Berkeley as a short-term scholar from November 2016 to May 2017.

My primary research interests lie in the intersection of agricultural/food economics, industrial organizations, and development economics. Under this broad scope, I am particularly interested in two areas: 1) organizations (e.g., manufacturers and retailers) in the food sector and their strategic actions, and 2) the impacts of policy/regulation shocks on the firmâ€™s competing strategies, and the effects on consumer welfare. I have particularly solid experience in policy evaluation and analyzing large datasets such as the retailer and household scanner data.

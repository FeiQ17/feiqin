My name is Fei Qin, a postdoctoral research scholar under the supervision of [Dr. Timothy Richards](https://search.asu.edu/profile/92424) at the [Morrison School of Agribusiness](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/agribusiness-degrees) at Arizona State University. I obtained my Ph. D. in Agricultural Economics from the [Department of Agricultural Economics](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/agecon/) at Purdue University in 2023. Before coming to Purdue, I earned my Master in Labor Economics from Shaanxi Normal University and my Bachelor's degree in Finance from Xi'an Jiaotong University. During my Master's program, I received the scholarship from China Scholarship Council, which allowed me to study in University of California, Berkeley as a short-term visiting student from November 2016 to May 2017. 

My primary research interests lie in the intersection of agricultural/food economics, industrial organizations, and development economics. Under this broad scope, I am particularly interested in two areas: 1) organizations (e.g., manufacturers and retailers) in the food sector and their strategic actions, and 2) the impacts of policy/regulation shocks on the firmâ€™s competing strategies, and the effects on consumer welfare. I have particularly solid experience in policy evaluation and analyzing large datasets such as the retailer and household scanner data.

I am on the 2023-2024 job market, and available for interviews. Please contact me at [fqin6@asu.edu](mailto:fqin6@asu.edu).

I am Fei Qin, a Ph. D. candidate from the [Department of Agricultural Economics](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/agecon/) at Purdue University. Before came to Purdue, I earned my Master in Labor Economics from Shaanxi Normal University and my Bachelor in Finance from Xi'an Jiaotong University. During my master, I received the scholarship from China Scholarship Council, which allowed me to study in University of California, Berkeley as a short-term visiting student from November 2016 to May 2017. 

My primary research interests lie in the intersection of agricultural economics, agricultural marketing, industrial organizations, and development economics. Under this broad scope, I am particularly interested in two areas: 1) organizations (e.g., manufacturers and retailers) in the food sector and their competitive strategies, especially the non-price strategies (e.g., product assortment adjustment), and 2) the impacts of policies/regulations/local shocks on the firm's competitive strategies. The countries I have been focused on are the United States and China. I have particularly solid experience in policy evaluation and analyzing large datasets such as the retailer and household scanner data.
